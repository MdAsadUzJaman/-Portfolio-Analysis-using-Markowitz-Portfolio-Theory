    "## Markowitz Portfolio Theory (MPT)\n",
    "Modern portfolio theory or Markowitz Portfolio Theory (MPT) is a theory that helps construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk for risk averse investors, keeping that in mind that risk is inevitable part of return. Risk and return are positively correlated. However, the theory paves the way to construct an \"efficient frontier\" of optimal portfolios that generate the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk. This concept was introduced by Harry Markowitz in his paper \"Portfolio Selection,\" published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance He was later awarded a Nobel prize for developing the MPT.(Cheng, 2003)\n",

    "In finance world, “FAANG” refers to the stocks of five giant American technology companies: Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX); and Alphabet (GOOG). In addition, the five FAANG stocks are among the largest companies in the world, with a combined market capitalization of over $4.1 trillion as of January 2020.(Fernando, 2017)\n",
